This provides a simple garage door opener web interface.
It has no security beyond whatever your wifi offers.
It does exactly what it has to and no more!

# How to use this

1. Check out this git repository in `/root/garagetron` on your CHIP or whatever Linux device.
2. Set up the GPIOs correctly (these work on a CHIP running kernel 4.3.0-ntc):

    408 is for the door
    409 is for the light
    410 is the enable line

3. Edit the lines in "garage.py" if you want to use a different GPIO port.
4. Figure out the IP address of the device.
5. Run `python garage.py`.
6. Open "http://ipaddress/garage" in a browser, and click the button!


# To automatically start the script on boot:

1. Copy the systemd service file to /etc/systemd/system/garagedoor.service
2. Run `systemctl enable garagedoor.service`
